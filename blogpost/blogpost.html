### Identifying Public Figures From Brief Descriptions

My goal was to identify people based on brief descriptions. For example:

puppeteer → Jim Henson
Pharaoh who worhsipped the sun → Akhenaten
made pill more expensive → Martin Shkreli

I mapped personal identities (names) to semantic vectors derived from their Wikipedia entries. When a query is submitted, I embedded them in the same space and returned a ranked list of the closest identities.

#### Method

* I downloaded all current English language Wikipedia articles from https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dump_torrents#English_Wikipedia
  it's a 66 Gb file, so I had to stream it in to extract the briographies
  * my version from Jan 1 2019
  * I identified biographies as articles which either:
    * had a birth or death category tag, e.g. Julius Caesar has `[[Category:100 BC births]]`
    * person infobox
    * tried 'people' categories but includes too many peoples and misc
    * to do: fictional characters
* Exposed via a flask app
